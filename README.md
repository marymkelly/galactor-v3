# Galactor III

![Example Screenshot](https://github.com/marymkelly/galactor-v3/blob/main/public/img/example.png)

This project is an updated version to a previous project of mine named [Galactor](https://galactor.marykelly.tech) [(repository)](https://github.com/marymkelly/galactor-the-second), incorporating a 3D globe using [Globe.gl](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-globe.gl).  

Visitors of this project can search and view nearby stars based on a location on Earth.  **A live version of this site is not currently deployed but will be shortly.**
